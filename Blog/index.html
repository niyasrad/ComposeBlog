                <h1>What's a Compose Camp?</h1>
                <h3>Compose Camps, according to me are events where you learn more on ”Jetpack Compose”, an UI - toolkit library designed by Google.</h3>
                <h1>By Who?</h1>
                <h3>GDSCs - Google Developer Student Clubs are to host these events to their own campus. In my case, I was the App Development Head of Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering.</h3>
                <h1>How?</h1>
                <h3>It was fairly hard to find Kotlin Developers in my college. Conducting a Compose Camp wasn’t exactly mandatory, but it was a challenge that i gladly took upon.</h3>

                <img class="representation" src="images/image 2.png">
                <h3>Being a Flutter developer, it was hard for me to learn Native Android Development. But Compose was there for me. All I had to do was believe in myself and study, train on the Compose Basic course by Google. I felt it was very difficult to pick up at the start. Not going to lie, I’d still prefer Flutter over Jetpack Compose for building an idea from scratch. In events like Hackathons, Flutter works the best for building an app. You can go wild with your ideas as long as you’re aware of deprecated syntax and a bit of Null-Safety.</h3>
                <h1>My Companion.</h1>
                <h3><br>Things were set for me. But I wasn’t able to motivate myself and learn something properly. So, I contacted my friend Sriram, who was another Kotlin, Native Android developer. He had developed a lot of basic apps with Native at that time. We learnt Compose together. We got him as the Co-Facilitator of this program.<br><br><br>Together, we studied and implemented Concepts everyday. We did a lot of development, and finally ready’d ourselves for the day. He was my support throughout the event, and he’s still with me and helps me out in difficult situations. Love you, Sriram!</h3>

                <h3>I felt the shivers run down my spine. I was about to throw up. Yet, I had an unlimited amount of confidence in myself when I was about to start. We had a grand opening, and I started inserting jokes while teaching as well. We were actually doing pretty good! After the first session, people came to us talking about how cool the event’s first scene went and people were excited to start with their Native Android Journey with Jetpack Compose.</h3>
                <h3>We covered the Basics of Kotlin, in the first session. That included classes and objects, functional programming, and basic syntax notes. Oh, and btw. People wrote a lot of notes. I’m surprised!</h3>
                <h1>Day I - Section II</h1>
                <img class="day" src="images/10 1.png">
                <h3>The start of a nice first-session gave way for an excellent and exciting second one. This time though, I didn’t have a mic. I had to scream my lungs out if i had to control the whole audience. And, I just did that. I got a sudden announcement that the Wi-Fi wasn’t working. People had a lot of errors in their application which could only be resolved by having internet access. </h3>
                <h3>When this was decided, I started getting into the zone. The zone of teaching. Yes, there are times you feel you’re performing so well, and you’re to make things amazing by having your full focus on a thing. It felt, unrealistic. I was also very glad to hear positive feedback after the second session as well.</h3>

                <img class="day" src="images/11 1.png">
                <h3>Umm, it goes overboard sometimes. I lost my voice after the day-before’s screaming and teaching. But, I had to use it to gain the attention of the students. Woah, I was able to shout again. This time, I went around asking a lot of questions on the day-before’s syllabus, So it was actually fun. We had a few breaks and chat-time, but it was mostly just business and teaching.</h3>
                <h3>By now, I had covered on how to develop their first mobile-app and how to use the UI plugin for smooth flow, and I taught them the general idea of why sketching your application before development is important.</h3>

                <img class="day" src="images/12 1.png">
                <h3>Okay, now this was a bit serious. I taught people State Management and why it’s very efficient to use some keywords and use conditionals. To demonstrate, I built the “Naruto SlideShow” app with them. Yes, it wasn’t actually serious (lol). The app featured images of characters from NARUTO and we displayed them with previous, next buttons to shift to the next image.</h3>
                <h3>After  a while, when i was totally out of juice to shout, We decided to host a small game. We provided the people who’d change my UI in the app or write Kotlin Code to print complex problem statements a reward. And boy, that was fun. We had people collaborate with each other as well.</h3>
